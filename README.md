This aim of this repo is to make an audio track with periodic noises, to help timing between exercises. The user inputs will be: no. of exercises, no.of sets, no. of reps, time between sets, time between reps. This will allow a button to be pressed which will play/pause the custom audio track.

To begin I will just try to make a track that chimes once every 6 seconds for a minute.
